Welcome to Python Adelaide Coder Club! Here's some things you might like to know:

## Important to know

- There is a [Code of Conduct](/conduct) that we expect everyone to follow.
- In an emergency, exit through any glass sliding door, and congregate in the courtyard by Wright St, next to the East of Norman café.
- Toilets and a baby change table are located in the hallway where you came in, near the stairs.

## About the venue

- There is free WiFi in the Minor Works Building; the ESSID is **AdelaideFree** and there is no password.
- Please help yourself to the cans of soft drink in the fridge courtesy of our food and drink sponsor Cloudflare, or water from the hot-cold tap over the sink.
- At around 8pm, there will be free pizza courtesy of Cloudflare.

## Get started!

- If you haven't already, join our [Slack workspace](/slack).
- At around 6–6:30pm (depending on when people arrive), we'll have a short "standup", where we go around the room and share what we're working on, to help find groups of people that can help each other out.

## Resources for learning Python

If you're completely new to Python, and you're not sure where to start, here are some resources to try:

- [How do I start learning Python?](https://automationpanda.com/2020/02/18/how-do-i-start-learning-python/) is an article that recommends different resources for learning Python from different backgrounds (new to programming, hobbyist, developer/SWE, scientist, software tester, kid).
- [Codecademy's _Learn Python_ course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) (free) introduces you to Python in an interactive, online environment, so you don't need to install anything on your machine.
