<h1>Speaking at Python Adelaide</h1>
<p>If you'd like to present a talk at Python Adelaide, either for our first meetup or on subsequent ones, please let us know by <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/W4ShVhseHSkuy6gy2">submitting your talk idea in this form</a> or emailing <a href="mailto:adam@brenecki.id.au">adam@brenecki.id.au</a>!</p>
<h2 id="but-what-should-i-talk-about">But what should I talk about?</h2>
<p>Anything that might be of interest to people that use Python! (Don't forget, lots of people use Python: not just professional and hobbyist software developers, but also scientists, mathematicians, teachers, students, systems administrators, and many besides.)</p>
<p>Here's a list of things people have expressed interest in at past Python Adelaide meetups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public speaking skills</li>
<li>Languages other than Python: R, Ruby...</li>
<li>IDEs and Editors</li>
<li>Science and Data Analysis</li>
<li>Python 3: Advantages, roadblocks, porting experiences</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>How to create a Python package and publish it on PyPI</li>
<li>Basics of Django</li>
<li>Sysops</li>
<li>MicroPython</li>
<li>Metaprogramming in Python</li>
<li>asyncio</li>
<li>How people got started in their careers / in Python</li>
<li>Python 3 type annotations</li>
<li>Packaging: the Python packaging ecosystem (pip, virtualenv etc); how to package code for Python</li>
<li>Testing and Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Parsing: writing parser grammars</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a broader, but still incomplete, list of suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fields that use Python: Web development, OpenStack, Education, Science and Data</li>
<li>Your Experiences: successes and failures, work projects, side projects, lessons learned</li>
<li>Python itself: Language features, the standard library, underappreciated built-ins, dark corners</li>
<li>The Python ecosystem: Libraries, frameworks, patterns, conventions</li>
<li>Tools: Editors, IDEs, source control, testing, continuous integration, static analysis</li>
<li>Things we can learn from outside the world of Python: Other programming languages, other platforms, other fields of science, arts and the humanities</li>
<li>Human factors: working in and managing teams, UI design and user experience, API design and developer experience, mental health and burnout, diversity and inclusion</li>
<li>New frontiers for Python: Embedded computing and IoT, mobile platforms</li>
</ul>
